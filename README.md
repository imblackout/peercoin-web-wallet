#### Installation

```
npm install
npm run build
```
You can then serve with whichever static serve solution you like. A simple npm one is `npm serve -s`, but you may also use NGINX or Apache. Additionally, if you deploy this application to Heroku with the create-react-app buildpack, it will deploy and run immediately.


#### Installation For Development

Run the following commands to setup on localhost:

```
npm install
npm start
```
